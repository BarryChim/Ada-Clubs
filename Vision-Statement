Brainstorm answers to these questions to help you craft your vision statement.
Who you’re working with, or hope to work with
What you’re doing
Who you’re doing it for, your audience (may be same as the previous question)
Why you’re doing this, the impact or change you hope to make
Put your answers together in a short statement.
Incorporating your responses, write your vision or mission statement in a short, simple format. Feel free to tweak the format. Color coding is added here for clarity, to indicate each key piece of information and where it appears in the statement:
I’m working with [community, allies, contributors] to [make, build, teach, or do something] so that [audience, end users, consumers, community members] can [do something different, achieve a goal]
Sample Statement:
