# Ada-Clubs
Welcome! This is the Ada Clubs repository. This repository will be used for the issue tracker. All the projects going through AC will use an issue to keep track of progress during the program.

## How to Work With Us
Each issue is a project currently going through AC. Find out more about each project how you can get involved in the individual issues.

## Participation Guidelines
### How to treat each other
* Be respectful and value each other’s ideas, styles and viewpoints.
* Be direct but professional; we cannot withhold hard truths.
* Be inclusive and help new perspectives be heard.
* Appreciate and accommodate our many cultural practices, attitudes and beliefs.
* Be open to learning from others.
* Lead by example and match your actions with your words.

### Inclusion and Diversity
Ada Clubs welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. It doesn’t matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you.

We welcome contributions from everyone as long as they interact constructively with our community, including, but not limited to people of varied age, culture, ethnicity, gender, gender-identity, language, race, sexual orientation, geographical location and religious views.

Ada Club activities should be inclusive and should support such diversity.

### Raising Issues
If you believe you‘re experiencing practices which don‘t meet the above policies, or if you feel you are being harassed in any way, please immediately contact the Ada Clubs organizers, Alex Hemming, Chris Pitcher or Tina Götschi.
